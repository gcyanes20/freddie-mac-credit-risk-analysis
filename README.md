Credit-risk analysis / Freddie Mac's Single Family Loan Q3, 2025


Business summary: 

This analysis evaluated Freddie Mac's Single Family Loan dataset from Q3, 2025 which comprised 165,007 loans. Key risk indicators identified included credit score, DTI ratio (Debt-to-Income , interest rate, and LTV ratio (Loan-to-Value). Across the DMV, Virginia leads with the most loan originations (4,635) and the highest LTV loans (969), while DC has the fewest loans (226) but the largest average loan amount ($495,991). Maryland borrowers are slightly more leveraged with the highest average LTV (76.7%) in the region. The predictive model examined normal loans with 100% accuracy but had a lower recall on high risk borrowers since only 313 out of 165,007 loans (0.19%) meet all three risk criteria (DTI > 43 , Credit score < 660 , LTV > 90) . Overall , Freddie Mac demonstrates strong underwriting processes as well as conventional loan standards; however, improving recall should be their main priority to mitigate potential losses from high risk profiles.
